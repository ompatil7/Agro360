  "NHigh": "The nitrogen (N) value of your soil is high, which might promote the growth of weeds. To address this, you can consider several suggestions. Adding manure is one of the simplest ways to enrich your soil with nitrogen, but it is important to be cautious as different types of manure contain varying levels of nitrogen. Coffee grounds are another excellent option as they are a green compost material rich in nitrogen. Once they break down, your soil will receive nitrogen while also improving its drainage. You can also plant nitrogen-fixing plants such as vegetables in the Fabaceae family, like peas, beans, and soybeans, which naturally increase nitrogen in the soil. Growing green manure crops like cabbage, corn, and broccoli can also be beneficial. Lastly, using mulch, such as wet grass, sawdust, or soft wood scraps, while growing crops can help amend nitrogen levels effectively.",
  "Nlow": "The nitrogen (N) value of your soil is low. To improve it, you can add sawdust or fine woodchips to your soil, as the carbon in these materials attracts nitrogen and helps absorb any excess nitrogen. Planting nitrogen-hungry crops such as tomatoes, corn, broccoli, cabbage, and spinach can also help, as they will consume a lot of nitrogen. Watering your soil thoroughly will leach the nitrogen deeper, making it less available to the plants. Adding sugar, which contains carbon, has been shown in limited studies to potentially reduce nitrogen in the soil. Composting manure and planting nitrogen-fixing plants like peas or beans are also effective solutions. Additionally, you can use NPK fertilizers with high nitrogen content or simply allow the current plants to continue absorbing nitrogen for future crops.",
  "NNo": "The nitrogen (N) value of your soil is up to the mark.",
  "PHigh": "The phosphorus (P) value of your soil is high. To manage this, you should consider a few recommendations. Avoid adding manure as it typically contains high levels of phosphorus. To prevent additional phosphorus from being added, you can use phosphorus-free fertilizers, such as those labeled with a ratio like 10-0-10, where the zero represents no phosphorus. Watering your soil liberally can also help to flush out some of the excess phosphorus. Planting nitrogen-fixing vegetables like beans and peas can help by increasing nitrogen without adding phosphorus. Crop rotation is another effective method to reduce the buildup of phosphorus in your soil.",
  "Plow": "The phosphorus (P) value of your soil is low. To enhance it, you can consider adding bone meal, which is a fast-acting source rich in phosphorus, or rock phosphate, which is slower-acting and requires the soil to convert it into usable phosphorus. You can also apply phosphorus-rich fertilizers, such as those with a higher middle number in the NPK ratio, like 10-20-10, or use organic compost and manure, both of which are excellent sources of phosphorus. If your soil is clay-rich, adding clay particles can help retain and fix phosphorus deficiencies. Ensuring your soil has the right pH, ideally between 6.0 and 7.0, is crucial for optimal phosphorus uptake. If your soilâ€™s pH is low, you can add lime or potassium carbonate to raise it. If it's too high, adding organic matter can help acidify the soil, improving phosphorus absorption.",
  "PNo": "The phosphorus (P) value of your soil is up to the mark.",
  "KHigh": "The potassium (K) value of your soil is high. To reduce potassium levels, consider loosening the soil deeply with a shovel and watering it thoroughly to help dissolve water-soluble potassium. Sifting through the soil to remove rocks can also help, as minerals in rocks like mica and feldspar slowly release potassium. It is recommended to stop applying potassium-rich commercial fertilizers and instead use fertilizers with a zero in the final number of the NPK ratio. Alternatively, you could switch to using only organic matter to enrich the soil. Mixing crushed eggshells, seashells, wood ash, or soft rock phosphate into the soil can add calcium. Additionally, using NPK fertilizers with low potassium levels and growing cover crops of legumes can help fix nitrogen without increasing potassium levels.",
  "Klow": "The potassium (K) value of your soil is low. To improve it, you can mix in muricate of potash or sulphate of potash, or try using kelp meal or seaweed, both of which are excellent sources of potassium. Sul-Po-Mag, a naturally occurring mineral, is also an effective option. Burying banana peels an inch below the soil surface can also help increase potassium. Lastly, using potash fertilizers, which are rich in potassium, can significantly improve potassium levels in the soil.",
  "KNo": "The potassium (K) value of your soil is up to the mark."
